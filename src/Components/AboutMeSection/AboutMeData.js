        description: "Hello, my name is Juan.  I have been programming since my senior year of high school and since then I have improved my skills. Some of the skills I have acquired include programming in several languages such as Java, JavaScript, Python, Swift, HTML, and CSS. I also have experience dealing with Queries to create, get, update, or remove data from a database. Have experience using mySQL, Core Data, Android Studio, XCode and most recently React Native. In the future I hope to become an App Developer, Software Developer, or a Web Developer because I find the process of creating a project that does a task to be very interesting and entertaining. Everytime I work on a new project I feel like its a puzzle that I have to solve and I see it more as a game rather then actual work.",
